#Hello everybody beginning my journey to learn coding check out some of the lists i did today.
#remember to be a good coder you need to be writing code not consuming tutorials i'd recommend picking up a book.

#Check out the lists i practiced doing today 


#This is a list                                                        

In [47]: list = ['This' , 'is' , 'a' , 'list' ,]                                

In [48]: # .append adds a new item to that list                                 

In [49]: list.append('see it works')                                            

In [50]: # now lets print and see that it works.                                

In [51]: print(list)                                                            
['This', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'see it works']

In [52]: #yep it worked yay!                                                    

In [53]: #ok now lets insert something into the list with . insert              

In [54]: #this adds a new item to any part of the list you choose               

In [55]: list.insert(5, 'just like life will workout for you with some practice'
    ...: )                                                                      

In [56]: #now lets print and see if it worked out for us!                       

In [57]: print(list)                                                            
['This', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'see it works', 'just like life will workout for you with some practice']

In [58]: #yay we did it congrats your doing awesome remember to learn coding you
    ...:  need to actually be coding.                                           

In [59]: #ok now lets remove an item from the list                              

In [60]: del list[5]                                                            

In [61]: #ok now lets print the last thing we added should be gone              

In [62]: print(list)                                                            
['This', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'see it works']

In [63]: # will finish up lists next time happy coding!
